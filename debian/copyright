Comment:
 The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
 software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to
 be valid for this artwork library too.
 .
 KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
 artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
 GUI.
 .
 Source code, for this library means:
  - where they exist, SVG;
  - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
    otherwise png.
 .
 The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
 notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
 .
 With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
 containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
 .
 The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
 the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
